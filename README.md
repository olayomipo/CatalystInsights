# Catalysis Data Analysis  
## README for Experiment Report on Catalyst Performance, Emissions Reduction, and Process Efficiency  

## Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing catalysis data to explore catalyst performance, emissions reduction, and process efficiency. The analysis uses Python for data processing and visualization, incorporating key techniques such as:  

- **Scatter Plots** to analyze relationships between catalyst properties, performance, and operating conditions.  
- **Line and Bar Charts** to visualize trends in emissions reduction and catalyst efficiency.  
- **Correlation Heatmaps** to identify strong relationships between key metrics.  

The dataset is processed to extract insights into catalyst behavior, enabling optimization of catalytic processes for improved performance and reduced emissions.

## Usage  
1. **Prepare the Data**:  
   - Ensure the dataset (`catalysis.json`) is placed in the `data/` directory.  
   - The dataset should include catalyst properties, performance metrics, and operating conditions.  

2. **Run the Python Analysis**:  
   - Execute the script to generate visualizations and save plots:  
     ```bash  
     python analysis.py  
     ```  
   - The output will include scatter plots, line charts, bar charts, and a correlation heatmap.  

3. **Interpret Results**:  
   - Analyze the generated plots to understand catalyst performance, emissions reduction, and process efficiency.  
   - Use insights to optimize catalytic processes for improved outcomes.
